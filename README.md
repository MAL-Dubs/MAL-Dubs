MAL Dubs is a userscript which labels 4775 English dubbed titles on MyAnimeList.net and  adds a "Dub Only" filter to search, seasonal, company and top anime pages.

Whether you watch dubs because you like to multitask while watching, because you have a visual impairment that makes subtitles difficult to read, or because you prefer hearing a performance in a language you speak, it can be hard to use MyAnimeList to find anime dubbed in English. This userscript fixes that problem.
